# Noise-level-and-light-acquisition-system

This system consists of light and noise level sensors, connected to a STM32F407 discovery development board. Information from the sensors is then sent to a WEB server
 where it is processed and displayed on a WEB application. Data is also saved in a MongoDB database. The WEB application displayes the data in 2 graphs, and offers
 the user an option to toggle a light located near the sensors.
